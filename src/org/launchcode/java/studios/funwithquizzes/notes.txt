Bonus Missions (not completed):

Add a short answer question type that includes validation behavior to only allow the user to enter text with less than 80 characters.

Add a couple of more question types to your program:
    Linear scale: a question that allows the user to provide a numeric response within an integer scale, which may vary from question to question. For instance, it could be 1-3 for one linear scale question, and 1-5 for another.
    Paragraph: Similar to short answer but allows for responses of up to 500 characters.

Add tests with JUnit to your classes.


Notes:
CheckBox only compares String[] and is not very robust. Maybe in the future I could add []/[X] boxes and allow the user to
    select and unselect before submitting. This would require using ArrayList<>.
